## La Torta Sbrisolona

- _La torta sbrisolona_ is like a huge crumbly cookie. It is typical of the city of _Mantova_ (Mantua, _in Lombardia_) and surroundings.
- _Torta_ = any sort of cake, pie, tart
- _Sbrisolona_ = Mantuan dialect for _sbriciolona_
- _Briciola= crumb→sbriciolare =_ to crumble, and as we saw last week, -_ona_ is an augmentative suffix. 
- Therefore _la torta sbrisolona_ can be translated as the big crumbling tart.
- _Questa è la ricetta di mia nonna Lidia._

_Buon appetito … e buona Festa del lavoro!_

### Ingredienti per 6 Persone

100 g = little less that 1/4 lb

- 100 g _di farina bianca_/white flour
- 100 g _di farina gialla_ (literally "yellow flour", corn meal)
- 100 g _di burro a temperatura ambiente_/butter at room temperature
- 100 g _di zucchero_/sugar
- 100 g _di mandorle_/almonds, _o un misto_/a mix _di mandorle e nocciole_/hazelnuts
- _un uovo_/one egg
- _la buccia grattuggiata di un limone_ (literally "the grated peel of one lemon")
- _un pizzico di vaniglia (opzionale)_/a pinch of vanilla — in powder or liquid
- _un pizzico di sale (opzionale)_/a pinch of salt, add it if you like some sweet/salty contrast)

### Procedimento

1. Preheat _il forno_ (the oven) at 180 degrees C, about 350 degrees F.
2. Chop _le mandorle_/the almonds. You want some of the almonds to be chopped roughly and some to be finely ground. If you like them, you can keep some almonds whole. In class we used a mixer/_un robot da cucina_. If you do not have one you can cover the almonds with paper towels and break them by beating them with a meat beater or something else heavy.
3. _Mescola_/mix (2nd person sing.) all the dry ingredients/_tutti gli ingredienti secchi_.
4. _Aggiungi_/add the grated lemon zest (grate only _la parte gialla, perchè la parte bianca è amara_, bitter) and the egg.
5. Add the butter in clumps. You do not want to over mix or knead, simply try to join the ingredients and keep large (about 1/2 inch in diameter) crumbs
6. Pour the _briciole_/crumbs in a baking pan covered with parchment paper (or covered with a thin layer of butter and _farina gialla_). You want to spread them to a thickness of one cm to 2.5 cm (about half to one inch).
7. Bake until golden (typically it takes 30 to 60 minutes, based on the thickness).
8. Let it cool down. When you serve it, break it with your hands…it will form a lot of _briciole_. It is perfect with a dessert wine, but for the next few years you should have it with milk or ice cream!
